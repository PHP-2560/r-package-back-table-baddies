We are creating an R Package that simplifies the inputs for elements of a graph. If using a package like ggplot2, the package often demands a strict order of inputs and a series of complicated commands in order to yield the elements of a graph. Our package will simplify this process by writing functions for several chart elements so that changing the aesthetics requires shorter commands. We will include the following elements:
1. chart type (bar, line, scatter, histogram)
2. chart title
2. axes titles
4. axes scales
5. show legend
6. legend placement coordinates
7. colors

Each student will contribute ~2 functions, one for each chart element.
