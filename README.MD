We are creating an R Package that simplifies the inputs for elements of a graph. If using a package like ggplot2, the package often demands a strict order of inputs and a series of complicated commands in order to yield the elements of a graph. Our package will simplify this process by writing functions for several chart elements so that the input must only assign a title or numerical value to each chart element. We will include the following elements:
1. legend
2. legend placement coordinates
3. title
4. axes titles
5. scale for both axes
6. chart type (bar, line, scatter, histogram) 
7. colors
